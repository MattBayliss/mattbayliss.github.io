##The chap

I'm Matt Bayliss. I'm a software architect for [iCognition](http://www.icognition.com.au) in Canberra, Australia. I get to play with many new and exciting features of the Microsoft .Net Framework and the C# language, and the Hewlett Packard's Records Manager SDK.

I have a long history of working with the World Wide Web (so long in fact that I still say "World Wide Web"). That history is mainly in web development, but I certainly have a lot of "dabble hours" in web design, usability and accessibility.

I also love drawing and illustration. I know Photoshop. Like, REALLY well. I love roller skating, and motorcycle riding. Dungeons AND Dragons.

##The site

After using GitHub a bit more in earnest, I came across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and thought it was time to resurrect a blog. In doing so I've learnt and used some new tools ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyllrb.com") and SASS and Chocolately to name three).

The current background is courtesy of the [Ames Research Center Image Library](https://archive.org/details/amesresearchcenterimagelibrary) (the reference number is AFST-37).

The theme is pretty much the default Jekyll one with some modifications.
